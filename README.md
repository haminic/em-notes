# Electromagnetism Notes

## ▸ About 📖

This repository contains the source code of my personal notes (in Thai) on **Electromagnetism**, written in $\LaTeX$. These notes are a product of my study of *"Introduction to Electrodynamics"* by David J. Griffiths, supplemented with other materials I see fit. I've also included the compiled PDF file [here](main.pdf) for ease of access, but note that it may not always be the most up-to-date version.

These notes are a **work in progress** and meant for **personal use**, so it is *very* incomplete and may contain errors, omissions, or unclear explanations. Please don’t rely on them as an authoritative source (or even as a source to study Electromagnetism, honestly). That said, I do hope it can still serve as useful to maybe at least 3 people.

This repository is public only for convenience, so I'd prefer it not be forked. If you’d like to suggest improvements or corrections and you know me, feel free to reach out.

## ▸ Credits 💳

A big thanks to Evan Chen for inspiring much of my preamble and formatting. Specifically, parts of my preamble are adapted from his [`evan.sty`](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty). While my preamble is currently a bit messy, filled with random macros and inconsistent naming schemes, I do plan on cleaning it up at *some* point.
